# terraform-aws-skeleton
A bare-bones Terraform module to be forked and turned into something useful.

## Assumptions

## Input Variables
* `aws_region` - Region to deploy our resources. (Required)
* `tags` - A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

## Outputs
* `some_output` - description of output

## Usage example:
A full example leveraging other community modules is contained in the [examples/test_fixtures directory](examples/test_fixtures). Here's the gist of using it via the Terraform registry:
```
module "this" {
  source              = "terraform-aws-modules/alb/aws"
  vpc_id              = "${var.vpc_id}"

  tags {
    "Terraform" = "true"
    "Env"       = "${terraform.workspace}"
  }
}
```
3. Always `terraform plan` to see your change before running `terraform apply`.
4. Win the day!

## Importing existing infra
Discuss the various terraform import commands that could be run to get this module close to owning a set of existing live infra.

## Testing
This module has been packaged with [awspec]('https://github.com/k1LoW/awspec') tests through test kitchen. To run them:
1. Install the prerequisites of rvm and ruby 2.4.0 via homebrew.
2. Install bundler and the gems from our Gemfile:
```
gem install bundler; bundle install
```
3. Test using `kitchen test` from the root of the repo.
